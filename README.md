## Build a stand-alone executable
Keep in mind that before building you will likely want to modify both the `HOST` and `PORT` variables located at the top of `basicRAT_client.py` to fit your needs.

On Linux you will need Python 2.x, [PyInstaller](http://www.pyinstaller.org/), and pycrypto. Then run something like `pyinstaller2 --onefile basicRAT_client.py` and it should generate a `dist/` folder that contains a stand-alone ELF executable.

On Windows you will need Python 2.x, PyInstaller, pycrypto, pywin32, and pefile. Then run something like `C:\path\to\PyInstaller-3.2\PyInstaller-3.2\pyinstaller.py --onefile basicRAT_client.py` and it should generate a `dist/` folder that contains a stand-alone PE (portable executable).
